Ruchi is a final-year student at MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Pune, specializing in Electronics and Telecommunications. 
Because of her keen interest in communications technology and Information Theory, she is collaborating with [Purva](https://algoasylum.github.io/2020/purva) and [Shrirang](https://algoasylum.github.io/2020/shrirang) on a project which began at the intersection of Information Theory and Decision Tree learning.
While she has no qualms about the classical space, her head's more appropriated to the quantum realm where Truth resides, and hence she spends a lot of time thinking and learning about quantum error correction and quantum computing.

She dabbles with writing about quotidian life, [literature](https://ruchipendse.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-case-for-realistic-fiction.html) and her [domains of interest](https://ruchipendse.blogspot.com/search/label/Entangled) on her [blog](https://ruchipendse.blogspot.com/), where she also maintains some really [bad poetry](https://ruchipendse.blogspot.com/2019/10/sad.html), the self-proclaimed humorist that she is.
She wants to author a book someday, but doesn't know about what, so she spends considerable time [reading](https://ruchipendse.blogspot.com/2020/10/book-recs.html).

Her interest can be piqued with a quirky factoid, an open-ended question, or by having a cat around.

Connect with her on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruchi-pendse-a9841716a) if you're interested in getting to know her work better!
